# TurtleSim Catch Them All

Description 
In this project, we will work with turtlesim
the used nodes are 3 :
  ● The turtlesim_node from the turtlesim package
  ● A custom node to control the turtle which is already existing in the
    turtlesim_node. This node can be called turtle_controller.
  ● A custom node to spawn turtles on the window, and to manage which turtle is still “alive”.
    This node is called __turtle_spawner__.
    the package of this project will be __turtlesim_catch_them_all__ to put our new nodes.
